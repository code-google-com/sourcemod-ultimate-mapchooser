#summary Documentation for the Post-Played Exclusion (umc-postexclude) module.

= Purpose =
  The Post-Played Exclusion module allows users to specify a an amount of time after a map is played that it is to be [AboutExclusion excluded from selection] in Ultimate Mapchooser. Specifically, it defines one new Map Group option called *"default_post_delay"* and one new Map option called *"post_delay"*.
  {{{
"umc_mapcycle"
{
    "A Group"
    {
        "default_post_delay"  "X"

        "A Map"
        {
            "post_delay"  "X"
        }
    }
}
}}}
  Where *X* is an amount of time in minutes that the map is to be excluded after being played. If *post_delay* is not specified for a map, the value of *default_post_delay* from the group the map belongs to is used. If *default_post_delay* is not specified for a Map group, it is assumed to be 0 (no delay).
