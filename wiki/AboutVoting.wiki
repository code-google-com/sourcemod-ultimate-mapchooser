#summary Information about Ultimate Mapchooser's Voting system.

= Introduction =

  Ultimate Mapchooser's voting system is based off of SourceMod's built in capabilities in _mapchooser.smx_. However, this functionality augmented by several features:

  * Ability to hold runoff votes.
  * Ability to block first few slots in the vote (to prevent accidental/spammed votes)
  * Ability to control how the votes are populated.
