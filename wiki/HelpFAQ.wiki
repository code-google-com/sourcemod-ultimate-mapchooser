#summary Frequently Asked Questions

==Why are my nominated maps appearing in votes?==

The most likely culprit is that the map you're nominating has a different group name than a group that's actually in the vote. This commonly happens when you have separate groups for voting/nominating, and it happens more often when there are separate UMC-Mapcycles for voting/nominating.

To fix this, you can specify which group a nomination should belong to by using the *nominate_group* option, outlined in the documentation for the [ModuleCore Core Module].
